### Day 1: 14/11/2024

### Day 2: 15/11/2024


**Today's Progress**: Finished off the freecodecamp cat photo hmtl lesson which teaches just the basics of how you can create a webpage only using html.

**Thoughts:** A lot of the things in here were covered by my precourse work for SoC but it still introduced me to new tags I have not yet been exposed to like form, fieldset, input and section.  Always good to re-go over the basics still.

### Day 16: 02/12/2024
