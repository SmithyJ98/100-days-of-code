### Day 2: 15/11/2024


**Today's Progress**: Finished off the freecodecamp cat photo hmtl lesson which teaches just the basics of how you can create a webpage only using html.

**Thoughts:** A lot of the things in here were covered by my precourse work for SoC but it still introduced me to new tags I have not yet been exposed to like form, fieldset, input and section.  Always good to re-go over the basics still.

Day 34: 10/01/2025


**Today's Progress**: Finished up the PATCH and DELETE requests and fixed error handling to the functions.

**Thoughts:**Functions were not producing the error statements when failing so we added "return result.rows.length > 0 ? result.rows[0] : null;" to turn empty results to Null which the errors worked from.

Day 35: 13/01/2025


**Today's Progress**: Started looking into creating our own tests for the functions we were making to ensure that they remain functional throughout development

**Thoughts:** Set up using Arrange, Act and Assert. Creating tests before actually making the functions can be useful. Currently testing using vitest.

Day 36: 14/01/2025


**Today's Progress**: Today I looked at doing test driven development by creating my tests before my functions to ensure development is focused or well thought through.

**Thoughts:** Honestly, I preffer doing the tests after instead of before and I feel in a real working environment, the way TDD consumes more time overall would be seen as a negative that outweighs the positives of coding this way.

Day 37: 15/01/2025


**Today's Progress**: Looked into using playwright in order to create tests after a project has been completed.

**Thoughts:** Picking out specifics of elements and automating multi step proceeses for tests is extremely useful, you just need to add in the assertions after.

Day 38: 16/01/2025


**Today's Progress**: This weeks hackathon revolved around make a Codewars type challenge where you give a prompt and an empty function for them to fill, using tests I have created to validate their answer.

**Thoughts:** More revolving around the teamworking aspect and checking up on each other than coding as it was a fairly simple task. We just need to check each others in the morning before presenting.

Day 39: 17/01/2025


**Today's Progress**: Wrote up the user side ReadMe, tested another users kata and had my own reviewed. Presented our Hackathon

**Thoughts:** Maybe needed to simplify my plan a bit more by making it more instructional, rather than a prompt. Used the other users tests to grasp how I needed to pass

Day 40: 20/01/2025


**Today's Progress**: Looked into React for the first time with the basic concepts and a simple workshop.

**Thoughts:** Used JSX to use produce react elements, use props to pass values, put elements into functions so you can reuse.

Day 41: 21/01/2025


**Today's Progress**: Spent a good portion of today looking through the react documentation and working through the examples they have included.

**Thoughts:** New things I have looked at are: rendering lists, responding to events, using states to update the screen, using Hooks and sharing data between components

Day 42: 22/01/2025


**Today's Progress**: Attempted to create noughts and crosses using react and vite.

**Thoughts:** Messed up from the start by not setting up vite correctly, so by the time all the functions were created it wouldnt push to the HTML.

Day 43: 23/01/2025


**Today's Progress**:This weeks hackathon was to create an app that includes flippable flash cards with questions and answers as well as giving the option to add you own aswell. We were given a design to make.

**Thoughts:** This went well, we struggled a bit with some of the CSS and put our own twist on it but the functionality went together smoothly as we took it component by component.

Day 44: 24/01/2025


**Today's Progress:** Continued the work from yesterday by fixing bugs and changing bits of styling.

**Thoughts:** Fixed bugs for: Unable to scroll back up when adding so many rows of cards, answer text being flipped. Added scroll inside of the flashcards componenet, padding and other styling

Day 45: 27/01/2025


**Today's Progress:** Looking at spreading and slicing of arrays and objects using ... and .slice() to keep data immutable.

**Thoughts:** Spread is used for pulling data out of an array or object, so it can be used again as individual values. Slice is for returning shallow copies of an array or object to a certain index value or range.

Day 46: 28/01/2025


**Today's Progress:** Looked into the react testing library as well as started looking into error boundaries.

**Thoughts:** The react testing library is similar to how Vitest works except you need to render your componenet when arranging. Error boundaries seems like very good practice for the UX.

Day 47: 29/01/2025


**Today's Progress:** Looked into react storybook and using reducers as an alternative to state

**Thoughts:** Make use of useReducer when you have multiple bits of state that often change together or managing more complex state logic that involves sub-values. Storybook is a development tool used for building and testing UI components in isolation and helps to visualise components outside the main application.

Day 48: 30/01/2025


**Today's Progress:** Started building a budgeting app using React and making use of bootstrap components

**Thoughts:** We severly underestimated how much data and states we would need to keep track of and manipulating the bootstrap elements to do what we want has taken a lot of time and research. We are nearly there with a MVP so we can hopefully get that sorted tomorrow.

Day 49: 31/01/2025


**Today's Progress:** Finalised the budget buddy app

**Thoughts:** Got the slider to work by taking the set percentile off the remainder, changed up the styling also.

Day 50: 10/02/2025


**Today's Progress:** Looking into the basics of typeScript

**Thoughts:** Set the type of a variable using :string =, : number = etc. This can be done with arrays to by doing : boolean[]= [true, false, true, false, true] For a funnction declare each variable in the brackets and follow it with the result type function addtion(a: number, b: number): number. Set up a type for an object using interface name {}. Set up a new type that can only have certain values using type name = option 1 | option 2

Day 51: 11/02/2025


**Today's Progress:** Looked into Sentry and had a go at setting up  an existing project with it.

**Thoughts:** Could not get this to work for me at all, tried on one of my projects then even forked a project off one of my other group members and it still would not get the initial error to finish setting up.

Day 52: 12/02/2025


**Today's Progress:** Reading through the docs for using next.js and used AI to make a basic page that we could look through and see the comparisons between normal react and this.

**Thoughts:** Using VO, we got together a card flipping app using next.js which used tailwind CSS. From here, we could see the similarities with basic react on how things like state and props are used, but the core difference was how the root was setup in the layout.js to render our app.

Day 53 & 54: 13/02/2025 & 14/02/2025


**Today's Progress:** Created a basic memory game app with the goal of using as much devops tools, techniques and mindset as possible.

**Thoughts:** Worked through using the CI/CD pipeline to decide how the app would be built and what it would use. Some of the tools we ended up deciding on were: Figma, V0, Github Actions, Docker, Vercel and Sentry. We managed to get our app working quickly thanks to V0 and then we started to look into the Actions. Our first plan was to automate built in test checks whenever someone pushed or made a pull request to main but we ran into compatibility issues when using Jest, then trying to switch to Vitest caused different problems which ultimately lead to us leaving it due to our time constraints. Instead, we added CodeQL and dependabot for some basic checks and update automation. From there, created our docker container but had issues trying to get our github project in there, so we moved to deploy it using Vercel but we ran out of time to go back and reconfigure our docker container to get the Vercel deployed app inside. We also did not have the time to get Sentry up and running.

Day 55: 17/02/2025


**Today's Progress:** Looked into security processes I could add the existing projects.

**Thoughts:** The main one I focused on was the middleware helmet. This was really easy to get setup on my projects and it assists in securing my application by setting specified HTTP headers to reduced vulnerabilities.
