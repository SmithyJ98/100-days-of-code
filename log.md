# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14/11/2024


**Today's Progress**: Finalized my pre-course work for School of Code by looking into errors in Chrome Devtools

**Thoughts:** I have now compelted my pre-course and have given myself a baseline of knowledge for when the course begins

### Day 2: 15/11/2024


**Today's Progress**: Finished off the freecodecamp cat photo hmtl lesson which teaaches just the basics of how you can create a webpage only using html.

**Thoughts:** A lot of the things in here were covered by my precourse work for SoC but it still introduced me to new tags I have not yet been exposed to like form, fieldset, input and section.  Always good to re-go over the basics still.
