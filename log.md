# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14/11/2024


**Today's Progress**: Finalized my pre-course work for School of Code by looking into errors in Chrome Devtools

**Thoughts:** I have now completed my pre-course and have given myself a baseline of knowledge for when the course begins

### Day 2: 15/11/2024


**Today's Progress**: Finished off the freecodecamp cat photo hmtl lesson which teaches just the basics of how you can create a webpage only using html.

**Thoughts:** A lot of the things in here were covered by my precourse work for SoC but it still introduced me to new tags I have not yet been exposed to like form, fieldset, input and section.  Always good to re-go over the basics still.

### Day 3: 16/11/2024


**Today's Progress**: Moved onto the next step in the Responsive Web Design section of freecodecamp and completed up to step 45 of creating a cafe menu. 

**Thoughts:** CSS was already introduced through the beggining of the pre-course work for SoC but this is allowing me to refresh my memory and get some practice in of the basics like basic styling and using classes. Will continue and finish this tomorrow.

### Day 4: 17/11/2024


**Today's Progress**: Completed building the cafe menu on freecodecamp which continued making use of CSS to style.

**Thoughts:** Showing off more CSS tricks that I have not been introduced to yet, such as styling links depending on things like being active or hovering, as well as starting to make use of changing display types for objects to adjust their positioning on the page.
